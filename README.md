# IIIF Annotations over P2P

As part of my Master's thesis, this project aims to distribute annotations on [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) resources within a peer-to-peer network among researchers, realized using the [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) distributed append-only log, courtesy of the [Dat project](https://dat.foundation/). IIIF, short for International Image Interoperability Framework, is a framework with well-defined standards and APIs to facilitate organization of images across institutions and on a global scale. [Read the thesis proposal](https://kassel.works/thesis) and occasional updates on my website.

The current state of the project tackles the general stack and attempts to test peer-to-peer distribution of annotations adhering to the [W3C Web Annotations](https://www.w3.org/annotation/). Further work will focus on realizing the distributed annotation layer as a module, making it available to third-party applications.
